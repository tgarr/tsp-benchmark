# tsp-benchmark
Scripts for automating the benchmark of TSP instances using 3 different solvers
(LK, LKH, and EAX)

The batch\_run script runs a given solver, for each given instance, for a given
amount of time, for every given seed. Multiple processes are lauched in
parallel.

GNU parallel is required: https://www.gnu.org/software/parallel/

# Running
```
./batch_run <eax|lk|lkh> <instances_list_file>
```

First argument indicates which solver to use. Second argument is a file
containing a list of TSP instances.

There must be a link to the solvers binaries in the 'solvers' folder. See the
README there for more details.

The list of instances must contain the path to the instances, one per line.
Paths can be absolute or relative to the folder where the scripts will be run.
Instance files must have the .tsp extension, and must be in the tsplib format.

The scripts 'eax\_run', 'lk\_run', and 'lkh\_run' execute the corresponding
solver for one given instance and seed, for the time limit set in the
configuration, and save the output the same way as the batch\_run script.

# Solvers
- EAX: https://github.com/tgarr/GA-for-TSP
- LKH: http://webhotel4.ruc.dk/~keld/research/LKH/
- LK: http://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/tsp/concorde.html (LINKERN solver)

# Configuration
- config/jobs: number of parallel processes
- config/seeds: list of seeds, one per line
- config/time\_limit: number of seconds a solver will be executed for each
  instance and seed 

# Output
The output generated by the solvers is stored in file with the following format:
output/solver/instance\_name\_time.seed

If a output file already exists, the solver will not be executed for that
combination of instance/seed/time\_limit.
